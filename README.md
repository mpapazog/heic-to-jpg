# heictojpg
HEIC to JPG file format batch conversion script

To run this script, copy it to a folder containing the HEIC images you want to convert and run it. It will non-recursively convert all images in the folder and save them into a new folder called Output.

You will need to have ImageMagick installed for the script to work: https://www.imagemagick.org/
